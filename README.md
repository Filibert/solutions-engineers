# Solutions Engineers
Welcome to the Solutions Engineer Repository

In this repository, you will find **two** folders with a test in every folder.

If it is your first time here, it's highly likely that you must only check the first test.

# First test 
The first test should only take you a few minutes. Just answer the questions that you'll find in the Readme file.

# Second test
You should do this test **only** if you have been told to do so.

This test should take from 2 to 4 hours. We will analyze the result of this test in order to determine the expertise you have as a full stack engineer.
